Sidney’s sonnet sequence Astrophel and Stella, from which these two selections are taken, was very influential in the work of other sonnet writers, particularly William Shakespeare. The sequence celebrates Sidney’s love for Penelope Devereux, who ended up eventually marrying another. Most of the sonnets are written in the Petrarchan (Italian) form with minor variations, most often in the sestet.

"Sonnet 31"
I. 1- Astrophe - the speaker, scorned in love, addressed the moon
1. 2 - "wan" - pale
I. 4 - busy archer - Cupid - the god of love
II. 5-8 - the poet, in so many words, is stating that he can see the signs of "unrequited love" in the face of the moon.
II. 7-8 - personification - the poet attributes the characteristics of a spurned lover to to the moon.
II. 10 ff. - the poet asks several questions:
    is love there the same as it is here?
    is love unreturned like it is here?
    is love of another as scorned as it is here?

A major theme in much Elizabethan peotry - unrequited love - love which is unreturned - often scorned or joked about.
