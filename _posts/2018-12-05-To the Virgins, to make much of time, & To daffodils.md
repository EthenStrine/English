As was the case with most of the Cavalier poets, Herrick's poetry reflects the ***carpe diem*** tradition - as well as the idea that time (and the end of a way of life) is rapidly closing in on them!

## "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time"

II 1-4 - *tone* - the first stanza, like the rest of the poem, conbines a light graceful tone with a serious message.

I 2 - time, like in Marvell's *"Coy Mistress"* is chasing us!

II 3-4 - *metaphor* - "flower" here refers to youth/virginity

II 5-8 *metaphor* - life is here compared to the course of the sun - a familiar image

I 9 - youth is the time to enjoy love - use it up now,  ``` because it will never be this good ```

II 13-14 - don't play hard to get - enjoy now! - and happily

I 15 - otherwise, you may end up in lonely old age!

## "To Daffodils"

This poem is an excellent example of the ***extended metaphor***.

I 1 - the poet ponders the *brevity* of life - mourning the short life of the flowers

II 2-10 - the basic idea here is that life passes before we are aware
