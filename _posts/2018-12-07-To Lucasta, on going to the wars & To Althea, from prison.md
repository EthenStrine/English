## About the Author:

Because of his loyalty to the king and his membership in the military during the Civil War, Lovelace's poetry reflects his dedication to honour and to the Crown above all else. Like Suckling, he lost all his wealth and land during the conflict, eventually dying in poverty at the age of thirty-nine.

## Poems

### "To Lucasta, on Going to the Wars"

I 1 - Lucasta is apparently an intelligent woman whose undertanding of and sympathy for the chivalric code is as great as the speaker's

II 5-8 - *metaphor* - the "new mistress" is honour - the conflict(war) itself - this is achieved through ***diction*** - the speaker using language associated with love when talking about war!

II 9ff - the speaker points out that his lover will, in a way, benefit from his service - by accepting these claims, a man of honour increases his capacity to love.

### "To Althea, from Prison"
