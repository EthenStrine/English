## About the Author:

Because of his loyalty to the king and his membership in the military during the Civil War, Lovelace's poetry reflects his dedication to honour and to the Crown above all else. Like Suckling, he lost all his wealth and land during the conflict, eventually dying in poverty at the age of thirty-nine.
