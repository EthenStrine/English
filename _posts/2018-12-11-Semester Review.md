The only sound was the roaring sea, The freezing waves. The song of the swan Might serve for pleasure, the cry of the sea-fowl,

First my lord went out away from his people over the wave-tumult. I grieved each dawn wondered where my lord my first on earth might be.

"Heart Exchange" Sir Philip Sidney

My true love hath my heart, ad I have his, By just exchange one for the other given: I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss; There never was a bargain better driven. His heart in me keeps me and him in one; My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides: He loves my heart, for once it was his own; I cherish his, because in me it bides. His heart his wound received from my sight; My heart was wounded with his wounded heart; For, as from me on him his hurt did light, So still methought in me his hurt did smart: Both equal hurt in this change sought our bliss: My true love hath my heart and I have his.

I'll hate so perfectly that it shall be Treason to love that man that loves a she. Nay, I will hate the very good, I swear, That's in thy sex, because it doth lie there. Their very virtue, grace, discourse, and wit, And all for thee! What, wilt thou love me yet?

Wilt thou love God, as he thee? then digest, My Soul, this wholesome meditation, How God the Spirit, by Angels waited on In heaven, doth make his Temple in thy breast. The Father having begot a Son most blest, And still begetting, (for he ne'er begone) Hath deign'd to choose thee by adoption, Co-heir to his glory, and Sabbath's endless rest; And as a robb'd man, which by search doth find His stolen stuff sold, must lose or buy it again;

The Son of glory came down, and was slain, Us whom he had made, and Satan stole, to unbind. 'Twas much, that man was made like God before, But, that God should be made like man, much more.

Thou art past the tyrant's stroke, Care no more to clothe and eat.

To thee the reed is as the oak. 20 The scepter, learning, physic, must All follow this and come to dust

Fear no more the lightning flash

Nor the all-dreaded thunderstone, Fear not slander, censure rash.

Thou hast finished joy and moan All lovers young, all lovers must Consign to thee and come to dust. No exorciser harm thee! Nor no witchcraft charm thee! Ghost unlaid forbear thee! Nothing ill come near thee! Quiet consummation have, And renowned be thy grave!
